CMSC 15200 Winter 2016
Lab 8 starter files

This directory contains the following files:

- Makefile

- bucket.h, a specification of the linked list bucket data structure

- htbl.h, a specification of the hash table data structure

- bucket.c, implementation of buckets (currently stubbed out)

- htbl.c, implementation of hash tables (currently stubbed out)

- html-main.c, main program to read strings, insert in hash table,
  display result

- cnets2016, a file containing fictitious cnets

- README, this file.

========

Your job is to complete bucket.c and hash.c, which are currently
written only to display error messages and exit immediately. You do
not need to provide additional evidence or tester files.

========

The expected usage of this program is as follows:

$ ./htbl <cnets2016

(You could direct any text file to htbl, not just cnets2016.)

The main program supports the -b and -s options, for "bad hash" and
"size" (i.e., number of buckets) respectively. These options can
appear, if they appear at all, in either order. Here are some
examples:

$ ./htbl -s 99 <cnets2016
$ ./htbl -b <cnets2016
$ ./htbl -b -s 200 <cnets2016
$ ./htbl -s 200 -b <cnets2016
